# Translator

Sorry for potential spelling mistakes but I'm French and I'm not so good in English.

For the documentation of the library check [here](https://github.com/Disk-MTH/Translator/blob/master/diskmth/README.md).

### Description:
This library allows you to manage a translation system in an extremely simple way. 
It supports compilation with Pyinstaller (you just need to include the translation files when 
compiling and setup correctly the library).

### Functions:

- set_translations_files_path(full_path, flat_build, build_architecture):
            This function is used to define the access path to the translation files


    Args:
        - full_path (required): The full path to the folder containing the uncompiled translation files
        - flat_build (optional): Put true if all your translation files are at the root of your project when compiling
          otherwise leave false
        - build_architecture (optional): The full path for your translation files from the compiled project root
